  header: "What is DC Design Week?"
  body: |-
    We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: *the District is more than just politics*.
    
    It’s a hub for performing arts and the birthplace of go-go music. It’s full of art and artists. It’s the diverse city that gives us energy and perspective. *We’re here to remind everyone that the DMV is full of people who possess that creative magic that leaves us all inspired*.
  body-2: |-
    ## *Who’s invited?*
    You. Your friends. Your co-workers. Designers. Not-designers. Everything-in-between. *Anyone and everyone is welcome*. We’re celebrating the creative voices of the DMV, and we want you to join us.
