    We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: <strong>the District is more than just politics</strong>.

    It’s a hub for performing arts and the birthplace of go-go music. It’s full of art and artists. It’s the diverse city that gives us energy and perspective. <strong>We’re here to remind everyone that the DMV is full of people who possess that creative magic that leaves us all inspired</strong>.
