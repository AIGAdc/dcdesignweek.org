    DC Design Week is committed to improving accessibility and inclusion efforts each year. We recognize this is a journey and we are still far from our ideal.

    This accessibility statement aims to:
    - Give transparency on what we’re working on
    - List accommodations we can and cannot provide
    - Provide contacts to request any accommodations that may have been missed or undocumented
    - Encourage feedback from the community on how we can evolve to be more inclusive in the future.

a11y-working-on-header: What We're Working On
a11y-working-on-body: "We’re working hard behind the scenes with our content curators
  to ensure all talks are inclusively crafted.\n\nSpeakers are strongly recommended
  to:\nComplete a Google Sheets accessibility checklist based on [Allison Ravenhall’s
  article Inclusive Design for Accessible Presentations](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/inclusive-design-accessible-presentations/).\nAttend
  an inclusive presentation seminar, read an inclusive presentation handout, and review
  Allison’s article.\n\nThe DC Design Week and AIGA DC teams are working on:\n- Targeting
  WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for our website and presentation materials which includes
  meaningful alt text, respecting reduced motion preferences, and understandable heading
  structures. We can’t cover everything as a team of volunteers, so if you see something
  wrong please let us know at [designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga.org).\n\n-
  Creating more documentation and templates for DCDW accessibility including:\n  -
  Inclusive presentation seminars and handouts\n  - Accessibility checklists for speakers\n
  \ - Accessibility statements for events. \n\nAIGA National is also currently auditing
  and redesigning the template used by all chapters, including DC, to make registration
  and access to videos more accessible to everyone.\n\nIs there anything else we should
  be doing? Let us know by emailing our accessibility team at [accessibility@dc.aiga.org](mailto:accessibility@dc.aiga.org)."

a11y-event-accommodations-body: "We’re providing the following accommodations for
  our events:\n- Real time CART (live captioning) services and transcriptions for
  virtual events.\n- Some [recordings will be shared with captions in the AIGA DC
  recordings archive](https://dc.aiga.org/introducing-the-aiga-dc-event-recordings-archive/)
  for AIGA members to rewatch or catch up on at a later date. \n  - If you’re not
  an AIGA member, you can [register for a membership on our website](https://dc.aiga.org/membership/membership-rates/)
  for just $50 for a year. We’re a 100% non-revenue generating entity, so this goes
  a long way to keeping us afloat. \n  - AIGA National is currently auditing and redesigning
  the template used by all chapters, including DC, to make registration and access
  to videos more accessible to everyone. If you have difficulties registering or accessing
  the recordings in its current state, please let us know at dcdw@dc.aiga.org.\n  -
  We can’t guarantee that all of our events will be able to share recordings as some
  talks may contain classified information. If we’re unable to do so, we’ll disclose
  that ahead of time in each of the event’s descriptions.\n- Volunteers at every event
  monitoring chats and conversations for [compliance to AIGA’s code of conduct](https://dc.aiga.org/events/code-of-conduct/).\n-
  When possible — shared materials and presentations for an event prior to it starting.
  Follow along comfortably with your own technology and at your own pace.\n  - We
  can’t guarantee that all of our events will be able to share their materials ahead
  of time because some talks may contain classified information or may not have the
  resources and time to do so. "
