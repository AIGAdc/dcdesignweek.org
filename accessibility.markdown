      best effort to ensure that every event is accessible to everyone. All of our events
      will have real time CART (live captioning) services.\n\n\n## Request an Accomodation\n\nIf
      you need an accommodation, please contact us by email through the provided Google
      link below or by phone. We honor your privacy and no identifying information (i.e.
      your name) is required to request an accomodation.\n\n- [Request an accommodation
      through this Google Form](https://forms.gle/gAQviAo5cTwWYGWV6)\n\n- Email us at
      [accessbility@dc.aiga.org](mailto:accessbility@dc.aiga.org)\n\n- Call our Accessibility
      Lead, Josh Kim, by phone at 571-302-1504\n\n\n## What We're Working On\n\n\nWe’re
      working hard behind the scenes to make sure our events are as accessible and inclusiveas
      possible.\n\n- All of our events will have real time CART services through [service
      name here]. Program leads must complete an [event accessibility checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1shzlfnSArTG-DbloZYlX8OolOblKoBRh2fxzdQFjMIo/edit?usp=sharing)
      while planning every event.\n\n- Speakers who use slide presentations must complete
      a [presentation accessibility checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lLG6J5kqcNqQxOHT7xRfPZSSyeN3FE8Dek-EFS8AyMY/edit?usp=sharing)
      based on [Allison Ravenhall’s article Inclusive Design For Accessible Presentations](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/inclusive-design-accessible-presentations/).\n\n-
      We’re making our website fully WCAG 2.1 compliant and are open to suggestions
      for improvement at [designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga.org).\n\n-
      We’ve consulted with various accessibility experts, including Nicole Barbuto of
      LookThink and Charles Hall, an invited expert of the W3C.\n\nIs there anything
      else we should be doing? Let us know by emailing our Accessibility Team at [designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga.org). "
