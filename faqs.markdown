questions:
  - question: How can I participate in DC Design Week?
    answer: |-
      This year, most programming will be virtual via Zoom or Zoom Webinar, or a hybrid of an in-person event streamed through Zoom. For all in-person events, we will be following CDC-recommended guidelines.
      
      For virtual events, we strongly recommend you join your Zoom session via your computer so you can easily view the presenter and any visuals they may share. Download the Zoom app ahead of time to make joining your events as smooth as possible. You can also join through your browser.

  - question: What is the Community-Curated Model?
    answer: |-
      This year, we’re shifting our focus to feature events curated and hosted by our community — so … you! We reviewed event proposals from individuals, groups, and organizations to pick diverse, thought-provoking, engaging events that represent DC. 
      
      Once chosen, event planners from the community were partnered with members of our committee to plan events that will take place this October.

  - question: How do I find the link for the event?
    answer: |-
      Once you’ve registered for your event through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with a link to the Zoom. You will receive the link again shortly before the event starts so it’s at the top of your inbox.
      
      If you have any trouble finding the Zoom link for the event, please contact us in the hour leading up to the start time.

  - question: I’m in a waiting room. How do I get in?
    answer: |-
      We want to create a more intimate space for conversations, ensuring only those who register for the event can join.
      
      Make sure your full name on Zoom matches your registration name by hovering over your name in the participant list, selecting “More”, “Rename.” If you have dialed in by phone, please send us an email immediately with your event name and phone number in the subject line.
      
      We will send reminders as people join the waiting room and will only admit those whose display name matches our registration list.

  - question: I’m having trouble with my Zoom. What can I do? 
    answer: |-
      We encourage you to explore Zoom’s [Help Center](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206175806) first. If you aren’t able to resolve the issue that way, reach out to us.

  - question: What’s your refund policy?
    answer: |-
      We will honor refunds up until 24 hours before your event’s start time. 
      
      We will not honor refunds:
      - for technical difficulties unless you reach out to us at the start of the event to see if we can help troubleshoot your issue (We’ll likely ask to see what steps from Zoom’s guide you’ve tried to start.)
      - if you aren’t admitted from the waiting room because your display name did not match our registration list.

  - question: "COVID-19 is rapidly changing: What happens if in-person events need to be cancelled?"
    answer: |- 
      You will be notified immediately and refunds will be issued. When possible, in-person events will be moved to Zoom.

  - question: Are there capacity restrictions for in-person events?
    answer: |- 
      Capacity restrictions will be officially decided about two weeks out from DCDW and posted on the specific event pages in order to follow the latest CDC guidance.
    trigger: question-8
    expanded: true
  - question: Will events be recorded? 
    answer: |- 
      All virtual and hybrid events will be recorded unless technical issues occur or recording the content disrupts the intimacy and privacy required for an event. The [recordings will be shared in the AIGA DC recordings archive](https://dc.aiga.org/introducing-the-aiga-dc-event-recordings-archive/) for AIGA members to rewatch or catch up on at a later date. 
      
      If you’re not an AIGA member, you can register for a [membership](https://dc.aiga.org/membership/membership-rates/) on our website for just $50 for a year. We’re a 100% non-revenue generating entity, so this goes a long way to keeping us afloat.

  - question: When I buy a ticket, where is the money going?
    answer: |- 
      The ticket sales cover our expenses, including streaming platforms and for live closed captioning. We’re also doing a revenue share to ensure our speakers receive some compensation for bringing their talent, expertise, and time to our community. 
      
      DC Design Week donates all profit from the week’s events to the [Design Continuum Fund](https://www.givecontinuum.org/), which helps launch the next generation of talented artists and designers by offering financial support for minority and economically disadvantaged students. In addition to the DCDW’s contribution, AIGA pledges 10% of all our event revenue to the scholarship fund as well. 
      
      We have tried to make our programming as affordable and therefore accessible to all. If you find the cost prohibitive, barring you from participating, please reach out to us at [designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga.org) so we can work together to find a solution that works for you!
