      in-person-body: |-
        Capacity restrictions for in-person events will be officially decided about two weeks out from DCDW and posted on the specific event pages in order to follow the latest CDC guidance.


        ### What COVID-19 precautions will be taken for this event?
        We are encouraging those not speaking, drinking, or eating to wear a mask.


        ### COVID-19 is rapidly changing: What happens if in-person events need to be cancelled?
        When possible, in-person events will be moved to Zoom and a refund should not be expected. If an event is canceled in its entirety a refund will be issued. In either scenario you will be notified immediately.

        in order to ensure only those who have registered for the event are able to attend
        — and to create space for intimate conversations.

        unless technical issues occur. The [recordings
        will be shared in the AIGA DC recordings archive](https://dc.aiga.org/introducing-the-aiga-dc-event-recordings-archive/) for AIGA members to rewatch
