  header: About DC Design Week
  text: |-
    Built by 100% volunteer power, DC Design Week is an annual celebration of this community, hosted by AIGA DC. AIGA Member On-Sale begins 9/5 at 10:00am and the General Public On-Sale begins 9/10 at 10:00am. 100% of the proceeds from DCDW events go toward future AIGA DC programming and the [Design Continuum Fund (DCF) ](https://www.givecontinuum.org/)  scholarship fund. We believe in fostering the next generation of designers through helping local design-minded and underrepresented students as they pursue their education.

  questions:
  - question: Do I have to be a designer to submit an event proposal for consideration?
    answer: |-
      No, you donâ€™t have to be a designer to submit an event proposal.

      If you are a floral artist, cake decorator, architect, or any kind of creative, we want to hear from you, so [submit your ideas](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAC1FU3ai5MsumhCs5cFa27g2t_ScaSyfgFmtFDcO3dF1zyg/viewform).
    trigger: question-1
    expanded: true
  - question: What are some successful event topics from the past?
    answer: |-
      Last year, event topics that were in line with what was going on in the world were very successful. Specifically, popular events focused on anti-racism, social justice, and accessibility.

      Craft-based workshops were also wildly successful. Nonetheless, event success depends on the expertise and enthusiasm of the hosting community members and speakers.
    trigger: question-2
    expanded: true
  - question: Will you offer support for logistics? For example, could you assist
      in finding an event location?
    answer: |-
      Yes. If your event is selected, you will be confirmed as an event within the DCDW 2021 calendar.

      One of the many things youâ€™ll get from us to assist with your event is a volunteer Event Lead from early summer through DCDW to support you with event planning, logistics, and marketing.
    trigger: question-3
    expanded: true
  - question: Are there any volunteer opportunities if I donâ€™t want to pitch an idea
      for an event?
    answer: |-
      Yes, DCDW is completely organized by volunteers, so there are small, medium, and large volunteer time commitment opportunities available if youâ€™re looking for other ways to get involved.

      Learn more about DCDW 2021, and take a look at the recording from our information session [here](https://dc.aiga.org/programs-initiatives/dc-design-week/).

  header: 'New This Year: Hyperlocal'
  body: |-
    Weâ€™re excited to announce that this year weâ€™re shifting our focus to feature events curated and hosted by our community â€” so â€¦ you!

    Have no fear, some of your favorite annual events will still be on the calendar (including inspiring keynotes, fun parties, and more!) But this year, because bringing the creative community together is more important than ever, we want to pass the mic to you. While larger events like the kick-off party and keynotes will continue to be planned by the DCDW committee, the goal for the community-curated model is to provide value through partnership by supporting the community in planning their own events for DCDW.

    <strong>The event proposal window is closed. Please stay tuned for this year's calendar of events.</strong>


     If you are interested in volunteering, let us know <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgPaJeTiKd_CezxfQw2JaIGeQYSqJffbBipjZKXmotXLm28w/viewform">through this form</a>!

  header: I submitted an event proposal. What happens next?
  body: "<strong>If your event is selected</strong>, it will be confirmed as an event
    within the DC Design Week 2021 calendar. <strong>Yahoo!</strong> \U0001F389\n\n<strong>We
    may work with you to refine some big picture event details</strong>, such as the
    overall goals for the event, your intended audiences, etc. We may also work with
    you to understand more of what you need from us in order to meet our mutual goals
    in planning and executing a fabulous event.\n\n<strong>What you get from us:</strong>\n\n-
    Your event will be included as part of the official DC Design Week 2021 line up
    and you (or your organization) will be listed as a partner. We will promote your
    event as a part of DCDW across our communication channels, which may include:
    shoutouts on our social media channels, promotion on our website, listed on our
    events calendar and other promotions scheduled for the week.\n- A toolkit of event
    planning and marketing resources to support you with putting on an impactful event.\n-
    A DCDW Event Lead (volunteer) to support you from early summer until DCDW with
    event planning, logistics, and marketing. \n  - While our volunteers will offer
    support, you will be responsible for planning and execution, and we expect you
    to meet us halfway in marketing your event through your own communications channels.
    Your DCDW Event Lead can work with you on what is the most effective way to do
    this.\n- Event registration administration (via Eventbrite)\n- Event accessibility
    support in compliance with ADA guidelines (e.g., closed captioning, verbit)\n-
    Event technical support (e.g., access to Zoom, volunteers to help staff the virtual
    events, etc.)\n- Access to additional volunteer support (week-of or day-of the
    event) as-needed\n\n<strong>What we get from you:</strong>\n\n- Commitment to
    hosting the event during DC Design Week 2021. We understand that life happens,
    but if youâ€™re submitting an event proposal, it means youâ€™re committed to making
    this event happen against most odds. \n- Agreement to follow the [Terms & Conditions](https://dc.aiga.org/programs-initiatives/dc-design-week/event-partner-terms-conditions/)
    of proposing and holding an event for DC Design Week 2021.\n- Commitment to our
    [code of conduct](https://dc.aiga.org/events/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=AIGA%20DC%20is%20dedicated%20to,%2C%20religion%2C%20or%20political%20affiliation.).\n-
    Commitment to your event idea. We know that ideas and plans can change, but DCDW
    selects its events with the entire week of programming in mind. We hope you understand
    that in order to ensure weâ€™re offering a diverse range of events to our community,
    we will expect the eventâ€™s overall approach and scope to evolve in a constructive
    way."
