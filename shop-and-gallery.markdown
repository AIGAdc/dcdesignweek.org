  this campaign that posters are nonpartisan and in window card format (portrait,
  11x17 inches).

# Shop & Gallery

---

In addition to this year's events and outreach, we're opening our very first DCDW Pop-Up Shop & Get Out the Vote Gallery. Thanks to our friends at Cherry Blossom Collective, Washington Project for the Arts, and Typecase Industries for making this happen. The shop and gallery are open all week and will serve as headquarters for DCDW.
