        DC Design Week is an annual celebration of the creative community in DC, Maryland, and Virginia. Over its 13-year history the week has grown and changed, representing more aspects of design, more members of our community, and more ways to be involved.

        This year, we’re doing more to foster conversations that will challenge, excite, and promote the grassroots history of the District; with a focus on the impact of the DMV’s unique local flavor.

        Each year, we host dozens of events, ranging from major keynotes with renowned graphic artists, intimate workshops with local makers, morning runs around the District’s murals, and more.
