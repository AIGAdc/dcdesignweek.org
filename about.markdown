  header: "What is DC Design Week?"
  body: |-
    The creative community in DC is an ever-growing body of professionals, makers, and voices working across disciplines. Hosted and produced by AIGA DC, DC Design Week is an annual celebration of that community.
    ### <strong>DCDW2020: Your Creative Voices</strong>
    We get it. People around the country hear “DC” and they immediately imagine lobbyists on Capitol Hill and buttoned-up professionals with offices on K Street. But those of us who live here know we’re so much more than that.

    This year’s DC Design Week will challenge that misperception by elevating the creative energy that flows through the DMV. Your energy. We’re here to show the world that we — the people who call DC and the DMV home — are so much more diverse, vibrant, and innovative than anyone can imagine.

    event, do all the outreach, and more. We’re so grateful for their contributions.
