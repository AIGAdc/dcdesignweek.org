dcdw-about-content-body-header: DC and Design have a lot in common
dcdw-about-content-body-text: "We have more depth than the surface suggests. More
  engaged communities than most expect. More originality than anyone thought possible…\n\n…and
  more possibility than any of us, on our own, could imagine. Which is why every year
  we come together—bringing the whole city into our fold.\n\nIn 2016 we took a giant
  step in the direction of celebrating design broadly and inclusively, elevating design
  as built spaces, social impact, creative strategy, technology, craft, the arts and
  much more.\n\nThis year, we’re in a full sprint. We’re working nonstop to ensure
  that every workshop, panel, studio tour, lecture and lunch event is curated to enhance
  community, connectivity, and diversity.\n\nTogether with AIGA and our dedicated
  partners, we’re challenging ourselves and we’re challenging the world to see design—and
  the city in which we create it—differently.\n\nAnd to see that we’re closer together
  than ever before. "
