What's black and white and drawn all over? &pizza boxes!

Make it personal. Keep it fresh. Elevate everything. Celebrate oneness. These are the guiding principles for &pizza, and that's what makes them an awesome partner for DC Design Week.

Join AIGA DC, &pizza and your fellow creatives to design your own pizza box. Show off your mad skills, eat, drink and win some prizes throughout the night. Only rule—the designed box has to be black and white. The color is in the pizza. Snag a spot before this event fills up!

Your ticket includes drinks and food supplied by &pizza, as well as blank pizza boxes and drawing supplies.
