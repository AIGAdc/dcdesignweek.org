Learn both the “why” and “how” of interface animation! Experts Kristen O’Callaghan and Dave Ellington will instruct workshop attendees on when and how to use motion to enhance user experiences. Kristen and Dave will demonstrate the tools and techniques for incorporating animation into a typical product/UX design workflow (access and familiarity with the tools is not required — see below for more information).

The workshop will be divided into two parts: 
* Part I: We’ll discuss the theory behind animation’s role in UX, explore the benefits motion can provide, and how we can use motion to our advantage as designers when developing a user flow.
* Part II: The workshop will do a quick refresher of the principles of animation and a discussion on the tools available for prototyping. This discussion will cover the use of prototyping tools such as Principle, Figma, Adobe XD and Adobe After Effects and their respective benefits and drawbacks. This segment will conclude with a demonstration of using After Effects (in conjunction with Bodymovin) to create and export a custom hover state animation for a button.
