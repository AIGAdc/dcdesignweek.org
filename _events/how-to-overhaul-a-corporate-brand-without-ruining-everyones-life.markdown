Deciding to rebrand your company can feel a lot like signing your company up for a revolution. It impacts everyone — it’s stressful, it’s expensive, and at some point, everyone starts to wonder if it’s going to be worth it in the end.

But what if it didn’t have to be that way?

In this talk, the team behind the rebrand of Northern Virginia-based The Great Courses Plus will talk about how they were able to completely overhaul a 20-year-old brand without making everyone involved miserable.

They’ll discuss strategies for how to build and maintain morale with the client team, how to equip the client with the tools and confidence to make bold decisions, and how to maintain your vision as a creative team — no matter what.


*This event was put together in partnership with [Viget](https://www.viget.com/).*
