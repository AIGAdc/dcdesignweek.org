Ready to have fun and give back at the same time? Join Game Genius, a play-based nonprofit supporting the DC area , for an interactive virtual workshop that features best practices of  the game design process and learn  how to use games for social good.

As a part of its mission, Game Genius selects an impact theme for its public engagements every year. This workshop will align with its  2021 focus: climate and environment. From biodiversity and natural spaces to climate and consumption, participants will explore different existing games before making one with a small group.
