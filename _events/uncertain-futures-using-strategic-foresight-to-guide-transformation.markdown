What do you do when tomorrow is changing faster than yesterday? 
Nobody can predict the future, but futurists don’t try. Instead, they use wide-ranging qualitative research, trend analysis, and strategic foresight to proactively move toward preferred futures instead of reacting to emergencies. By using our creative abilities to bring possible futures to life, designers can help drive organizational motivation to “back-cast” how to prepare for otherwise unexpected events. 

Presented by Kelly Tsao, a UX designer with a passion for research and design theory,  this presentation is an introduction to futurism in relation to service design and strategy, and how creative people are uniquely skilled to envision a more desirable future.
