AIGA 50 IS BACK and our community’s best creative work will NOT disappoint! This year we posed one simple question to our community: What is good design?

Submissions poured in from across the DMV region and we are honored to close out DCDW 2020 by peering behind the curtains to get a better look at this amazing work.

Join our six AIGA 50 judges as they sit down with some select winners — including our inaugural student winners — to reveal the nitty gritty about their process and lessons-learned. Plus, you’ll hear directly from a special winner — someone who won TWO judge’s choice awards and the Design for Good Award. There’ll be plenty of time for Q+A, so you can learn everything you want about the latest design trends how award-winning work gets done.

You won’t want to miss this celebration of our region’s creative past, present and future!
