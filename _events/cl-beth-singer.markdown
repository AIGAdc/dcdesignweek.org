Beth Singer Design is a design communications firm specializing in nonprofit organizations with concentration in Jewish and Israel-centric, education, cultural and health advocacy organizations. Their tagline is: "Helping those who do good, do better." And indeed they do. Their work has raised millions of dollars, changed minds, opened hearts and inspired ordinary people to act on their ideals for the greater good.

Beth Singer Design will share with you their 35-year journey marrying passion for design and doing good in the world...and where it has led them (some very interesting places!). Additionally, they will discuss YOUR LEGACY: How will you make your mark on the world beyond your work? How can you make a lasting effect on others using design? And how will you ensure your efforts live beyond your lifetime?

**Lunch is included.** Registration is $10, limited to 15 attendees and is open to **AIGA members first!**

Please plan to arrive at Beth Singer Design 10 minutes early to allow time for registration, lunch and swapping stories with other designers. The presentation will begin promptly at noon.
