  bio: Jesse Kirsch is an award-winning graphic designer, art director, and owner
    of No Plan Press, a boutique letterpress and design studio. A graduate of the
    School of Visual Arts in New York City, he has been working professionally in
    the arts for over 20 years. Jesse enjoys finding new methods of using geometry,
    color, and typography, often in a way that explores everyday subjects from a different
    perspective. Inspired by the juxtaposition of new and old technologies, his work
    combines the latest in modern design software with century-old vintage printing
    equipment. Originally from New Jersey, Kirsch now lives in Takoma Park, Maryland
    with his wife, two boys and cat Penny.

Graphic designer and entrepreneur Jesse Kirsch presents a creative morning that will explore his artistic background, as well as his recent venture into the world of letterpress printing with the realization of his passion project: No Plan Press. 

Having “no plan” of where the business would ultimately take him, Jesse started printing out of his garage in late 2019, and was soon selling out of limited-edition prints he designed to help small businesses affected by the pandemic and other local causes. He will discuss how his “hyper-local” focus helped him stand out in the printing and design world and proved to be a formula for success.

The morning will conclude with a fun, hands-on project allowing guests to get their hands on a vintage 1940s Vandercook proofing press and bring home their own letterpress poster.


*This event was put together in partnership with [No Plan Press](https://www.noplan.press/).*
