We’re Humankind Studio and we work in weed! It started as a small project, designing a single piece of packaging. Seven years later, we’re the creative agency of record for the largest privately-held cannabis company in America. In this interactive session, including polls and Q&A, we will light up the screen and spark your curiosity with: 

* How we weathered the pandemic (and grew the studio) by embracing an unexpected opportunity
* Increased competition and opportunities in cannabis
* Our own work with four leading retail and wholesale brands, including:
     + Brand strategy and design
     + Retail design
     + Digital advertising
     + Social media 
     + Out of home

Harvest what it means to work in today’s cannabis business and get high on design.


*This event was put together in partnership with [Humankind Studio](https://www.humankindstudio.com/).*
