Trauma-informed content strategy can help you create designs and an experience that make vulnerable populations feel safe, respected, and understood when they come to the government for services. Content strategist, Tamar Fox, will share case studies where she changed language and processes to make it easier for people in crisis to get help. Together, we will talk about how to write and design content for people in the midst of a traumatic event, such as experiencing homelessness, medical emergencies, or an international pandemic. You’ll have a chance to try your hand at writing some trauma-informed content after examining examples together.
