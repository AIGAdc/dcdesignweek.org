Human-Centered Design (HCD) has become a ubiquitous skill present in most IT teams today and is a skill found within all levels of an organization; although, these skills were not always present and the transition didn't happen without friction and negotiation between cross-functional teams over the years. In this discussion, we will explore what the panel has learned during our experiences integrating HCD into traditional IT environments.


*This event was put together in partnership with [Metrostar](https://www.metrostar.com/).*
