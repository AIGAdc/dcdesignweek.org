    bio: " For more than 80 years Globe Poster Printing Corp. promoted the people’s
      entertainment, including vaudeville, burlesque, movies, circus and carnival
      acts, and found its groove in the 1960s with posters for top R&B and rock acts
      like Mavis Staples, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye and the Beach Boys. When they
      closed shop in 2011, the Maryland Institute College of Art stepped in to preserve
      the archive and to ensure the Globe story didn’t end. Today, Globe's legacy
      endures as the Globe Collection and Press at MICA, a working press, a teaching
      tool, and a source for research."
