  bio: " For more than 80 years Globe Poster Printing Corp. promoted the people’s
    entertainment, including vaudeville, burlesque, movies, circus and carnival acts,
    and found its groove in the 1960s with posters for top R&B and rock acts like
    Mavis Staples, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye and the Beach Boys. When they closed
    shop in 2011, the Maryland Institute College of Art stepped in to preserve the
    archive and to ensure the Globe story didn’t end. Today, Globe's legacy endures
    as the Globe Collection and Press at MICA, a working press, a teaching tool, and
    a source for research."
