As a DEIB practitioner and interior design/color consultant, Jessica Bantom is passionate about how the values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging apply to the design disciplines. Together, we will explore the importance of understanding, appreciating, and interacting with people from different cultural backgrounds to achieve outcomes that honor humanity and resonate in our increasingly global economy. She will discuss what it means to design with cultural competence, why it’s important, and share practices of culturally competent designers.

This session will highlight real-life case studies of culturally incompetent design and address various ways that culture and design intersect in the local DC area. The session will also include an interactive component for exploring what it looks like for designers to address challenges around culture as they arise.
