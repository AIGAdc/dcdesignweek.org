  black tank-top with silver earrings and necklace. Her black hair is swept to one
  side as she smiles at the camera. A middle-aged, bald and bearded white dude smiling
  subtly but looking somewhat austere in a gray, flannel collared shirt and casting
  a dark shadow on a light gray backdrop. A youthful white woman with wavy, light
  blond hair wearing red lipstick and a silver nose piercing smiles cheerfully, in
  a black, long sleeve turtleneck top.'

At Bixal, we believe fast cycles of prototyping and testing accelerate learning, reduce risk, and improve outcomes. As government agencies are modernizing their websites and improving customer experience using the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS), we're working to empower designers to take ownership of prototyping in the web medium and enable them to better collaborate with developers through the common language of the USWDS.

A typical need we see in government is for people to fill out a simple screener before they complete a larger task. When these forms are long, onerous, and confusing, they lead to wasted time and bad data. For our case study, we'll show you how we prototyped and tested 3 versions of an HHS screener in less than 4 weeks, making major improvements in accessibility, usability, and user experience.

And then we'll walk you through how you can take what we built and reuse the template for your own rapid prototyping purposes!
