An interactive workshop for design professionals who are interested in cultivating an intentional and joyful design process dedicated to equity, inclusion, and justice. The workshop features an exploration of traditional design processes and how they no longer serve our societal or personal needs. Attendees will learn about  mid-process and completed project case study shares (Shaw DC, Tulsa, OK, and Arlington, VA), participate in self-inquiry exercises to catalyze their  own paths, and join small group breakouts for community sharing. The workshop is for everyone regardless of where they are in their design journeys. 

** This event has two ways to participate: there are limited spaces for in-person attendance as well as a larger amount of spaces for virtual attendance via Zoom.
