Elections have always been fraught with challenges for disabled voters. (Seriously, what good is an audio voting machine if the staff doesn’t know how to turn it on?) With a pandemic radically changing how we approach voting, we must confront those challenges more than ever — and have an opportunity to make big changes for the better.

How does design play a role? How can we address those barriers between citizens and civic engagement? Is mail-in voting really enough? How can we advocate for and design better systems that make democracy work better?

Join us for a discussion with Michelle Bishop to examine the systems behind the challenges and the complicated tangle of equipment, public awareness, political will, and staff training required to keep fighting for access for all.
