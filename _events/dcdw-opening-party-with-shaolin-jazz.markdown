    bio: |-
      SHAOLIN JAZZ, founded by Gerald C Watson II and DJ 2-Tone Jones, is a multimedia company that creates content and produces events that highlight the parallels and cultural intersections between hip-hop, jazz, and martial arts.

      Their content ranges from conceptually driven artwork, to their critically acclaimed mixtapes that feature instrumentals from hand-selected jazz greats, such as Miles Davis and Nancy Wilson, which are cleverly fused with acappellas from the legendary rap group Wu-Tang Clan. Their events range from movie screening events which are scored live by a DJ, live performances featuring a DJ led live band, art shows, and multimedia lectures that explore the parallels between hip-hop culture and jazz culture.
