  bio: |-
    SHAOLIN JAZZ, founded by Gerald C Watson II and DJ 2-Tone Jones, is a multimedia company that creates content and produces events that highlight the parallels and cultural intersections between hip-hop, jazz, and martial arts.

    Their content ranges from conceptually driven artwork, to their critically acclaimed mixtapes that feature instrumentals from hand-selected jazz greats, such as Miles Davis and Nancy Wilson, which are cleverly fused with acappellas from the legendary rap group Wu-Tang Clan. Their events range from movie screening events which are scored live by a DJ, live performances featuring a DJ led live band, art shows, and multimedia lectures that explore the parallels between hip-hop culture and jazz culture.

Kicking off the start of DC Design Week 2021, we’re joining forces with SHAOLIN JAZZ as they celebrate their 10th Anniversary. DJ 2Tone Jones and Gerald Watson will be diggin’ in the crates musically and visually to showcase selected works through their SOUND PATTERNS Art Exhibition which includes album covers, event posters, and iconography that look back over the 10 years SHAOLIN JAZZ have been producing community based events.

We’ll also have drink and draw with featuring selected artwork from SHAOLIN JAZZ and DC based artist, designer and muralist, Kelly Towles. 

There will be drinking, there will be music and there will be dancing, you won’t want to miss it!
