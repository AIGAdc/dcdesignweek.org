How we take care of our mind and body deeply impacts our ability to create. When we slow down long enough and create space for introspection, we’re better equipped to show up fully and with more ease and confidence.

With the aid of gentle movement, mindfulness, and introspective journaling, this  workshop will cover various creative obstacles, including:
* Perfectionism and procrastination: You’ll learn how to combat negative inner chatter and make room for our art.
* Imposter syndrome: You’ll learn how to stop playing small and second guessing yourself  at work.
* Enforcing boundaries: You’ll learn how to maintain a balance among relationships, work, and other responsibilities in life.

Come join us for an event to feel more connected to yourself and others!
