What guides you to create your best work or a better life?

At Project Design Co, we asked ourselves this question and dove into a month-long team retreat to find our core values. What was what we call our Pillars of Design, a set of six words that flow through all our work. They guide us when we face a blank screen, a new proposal, a crushing deadline, ourselves and each other.

Whether in your work or personal life, you can benefit from establishing clearer signs to point the way.  This workshop will guide you through a condensed journey to establish or hone your own set of pillars that resonate with you. We’ll help you identify, develop & incorporate your own keywords to drive you to success in all you do.

In this workshop, you'll:
*  Start building a foundation based on passion, drive, curiosity, experience, and goals. 
* Identify times you made a big change, what made it successful, and learn how you can apply this knowledge. 
* Identify your "why's" of what you do. 
* Learn about the importance of word choice and intent.
* Gain insights to your core values.
* Brainstorm and review your ideas in small breakout groups.
* Walk away with a set of pillars that you can take back to your team or start implementing now.

This workshop is for any designer (freelance or part of a team), manager, or leader who is looking to strengthen their own brand, gain focus, and connect with purpose.


*This event was put together in partnership with [Project Design Co.](https://www.projectdesigncompany.com/).*
