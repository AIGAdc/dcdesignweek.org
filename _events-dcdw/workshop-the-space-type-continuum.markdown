Want to make your typography come alive? Join designer and MICA educator Kiel Mutschelknaus’ Space Type Continuum workshop on Saturday, September 21 from 1:00 - 4:00pm at ISL.

Kiel’s most recent project, an online motion and type generator called _Space Type Generator,_ has been featured in _[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18287129/kiel-mutschelknaus-space-type-generator-animation-design-motion-graphics-coding){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}_ and _[It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/kiel-mutschelknaus-space-type-generator-graphic-design-digital-160519){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}_. Attendees will learn Kiel’s innovative approach to making a typographic generator from (almost) scratch in under 3 hours.

The workshop will begin with an introduction to the basics of coding. After laying this important groundwork, we’ll move onto basic motion and typography to create a simple yet robust typographic generator. Various versions of Space Type Generator will be dissected to demonstrate how the presented foundational elements can be built out even further to create a myriad of iterations.

_Participants will be required to bring a laptop and charging cord. A basic understanding of JavaScript is recommended but not required._

**COOL STUFF ALERT!** 🚨 Attendees will walk away with their own generator and the general knowledge necessary to begin customizing their own generator iterations. So you, too, can create graphics like:

  <source src="/uploads/stg_apr25a.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

**Venue Accessibility (elevators, stairs, etc.):**
ISL is accessible from the back entrance of the building.

**Transportation / Helpful Directions to Venue (metro stop, parking availability):** ISL is steps away from the S Street exit of the Shaw - Howard University metro station (Green/Yellow lines). Escalator and elevator from the metro station are located at 7th and S Streets NW.
