    We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: <strong>the District is more than just politics</strong>.

    It’s a hub for performing arts and the birthplace of go-go music. It’s full of art and artists. It’s the diverse city that gives us energy and perspective. <strong>We’re here to remind everyone that the DMV is full of people who possess that creative magic that leaves us all inspired</strong>.

      ### [Verse 1]


      
      You wear the face of strength
      The [armor](#) of a tank
      Keep ya' calm in a bomber's brink
      Your eyes are another paint
      I seen their true colors through your blinks
      Thin out I'm not here to exploit your chinks
      More to reinforce 'em, from the forces sent to see you sink
      Stay afloat, and stay a while, and take a break
      All you hear is orders barking, brick
      And mortar stopping walls and space
      What a shame becoming blame of roots, and no escape
      Closing gates on fate like all mistakes are born in place
      All it takes is pressing forth with form and grace
      Forge a bond with more than hate
      Meet these words with open arms
      And plant your feet the planet shakes
