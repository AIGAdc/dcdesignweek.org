hyperlocal-header: '2021: Hyperlocal: Grown locally. Inspire Globally.'
hyperlocal-body: We aspire to foster conversations that will challenge, excite, and
  promote change. We want to lean into the call and response nature of design and
  the grassroots history of the District; with a focus on the DMV’s unique local flavor
  and its impact, particularly Gogo music and culture. Design constitutes different
  points of reference. Local makers can expect our vision for the future to be pluralistic
  and our art and design practices to contain a multitude of perspectives and experiences.
